## Features
- Just a simple lightbox popup for quick login actions.
- Changes the behaviour of the normal login button in the header.
- Only activates on pages where there is no normal login form (not when trying to access the UCP for example).

#### Requirements
- phpBB 3.1.0 or higher
- PHP 5.3.3 or higher

#### Languages supported
- No language files included/necessary

#### To do list
- Since JS is required, we might use it position the popup better. The current method uses only CSS, but that has it's limitations.
